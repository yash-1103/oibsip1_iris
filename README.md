Iris Flower Classification
In this analysis of the Iris dataset, we successfully built a Random Forest Classifier model that demonstrated high accuracy in classifying iris flowers into their respective species. The dataset, consisting of sepal and petal measurements for three iris species, setosa, versicolor, and virginica, was thoroughly explored and preprocessed. The model's predictive capabilities were assessed using key metrics, revealing its effectiveness in distinguishing between these species. This project serves as an illustrative example of classification in the field of data science and showcases the practicality and accuracy of the Random Forest algorithm in real-world applications.
